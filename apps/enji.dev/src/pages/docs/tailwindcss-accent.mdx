## More on Topic - NFT

The `NFT` comes into play as a cosmetics, meaning BladeOff has collaboration with a lot of NFT holders projecting their look and cosmetics to our blades. We do not sell our own NFTs.

<InlineHighlight>`NFT`</InlineHighlight> doesn't affect the quality, speed or any
sort of peformance of our blades, but rather just adding the visual aspect instead.

## BladeOff Client

### Multiplayer

The players are matched using the client, where the user may invite teammates, or hop into matchmaking where the players will be connected with four others in the _arena_.

The client will have the shop added soon, in the newer builds, where the users will be able to upgrade their blades such as adding different looks, side-blades or just color.

### Ranking System

While battling other players, you will be able to obtain ranking points and be placed higher ona leaderboard.

Amount of points obtained is dependent on your current leaderboard position, what place did you finish the battle, and what players did you eliminate during the battle.

Let the battles begin ðŸ”¥
