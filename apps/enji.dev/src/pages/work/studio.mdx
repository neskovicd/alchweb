Team is rapidly growing so the list may not always be correct.

### Favorite Device

For Unity, we mainly use **MacBook Pro M2s** as our backup work companion, as we can hop to our projects from any location, and Unity being pretty resource light.

Its powerful performance and long battery life ensure that productivity knows no bounds, whether we're at a coffee shop or exploring remote locations.

It also helps us perform comprehensive **compatibility** checks for websites on the Safari browser, which is exclusive to Mac devices.

But lastly but also **mainly**, we also have use iPhones with it in sync, which comes in handy for testing mobile games we create.

## Workstation

For rendering and bulding, our Unreal Engine developers and modellers/animators use Windows Computers equipepd with powerful specs.

A powerful build reduces our rendering and build times drastically, boosting speed and efficincy of our developers and modellers.
